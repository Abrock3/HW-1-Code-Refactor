# HW-1-Code-Refactor

## Description

I was instructed to start with a set of pre-written HTML and CSS code and some provided images, and to make the code simpler, cleaner, and more accessible while preserving its previous functionality. I was asked to use this list of acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In order to allow the document to be more readable for a screen reader, and for SEO, I replaced all div elements with more descriptive elements, added and removed classes and ids where necessary to fix links and simplify the CSS, added descriptive alt attributes to some images and a null alt attribute to decorative images, and added a descriptive title to the page. I also modified/condensed the CSS down to a much more manageable and readable length, and rearranged it to make it follow the document flow of the HTML doc.

In order to determine what semantic elements to use, I extensively used this explanation: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

I used the following text to determine when to use the null alt tag for an image: https://pressbooks.ulib.csuohio.edu/accessibility/chapter/chapter-3-6-creating-an-empty-or-null-alt-attribute-for-decorative-images/#:~:text=Decorative%20images%20require%20the%20addition,between%20the%20set%20of%20quotes.
